       " 'daren ,thinking about robert \\' s little memo yesterday and along the lines of pullingthe marketing ( sitara ) function back to your side of the fence i think astrong case could be made in favor of that idea .it is obvious that several people are involved in changing tickets , pathing ,nominating , and confirming the industrials . this dissipates the knowledgebase and the responsibility factor . it is a \" who \\' s on first \" issue .if the responsibility to ensure pricing , volume , and accomplishment of marketintent is accurately depicted , and in sitara , is in your shop then theschedulers could concentrate on the accuracy and correctness of unify andpops . i \\' m sure this would help volume management and client servicesimmensely .as the skill level rises in this area you could then gradually feed more andmore of the marketing function ( sitara ) to the scheduling group in the hopesthey would then have a better understanding of the overhaul picture .i believe the current situation is too much , too fast , for scheduling tohandle all at once . it has also created a situation where robert seems tothink not only that he has all the segments mastered , but that he is the onlyperson that should be involved in the industrials .i will support whatever direction you want to go on this issue , but if youand pat leave things the way they are please explain to both robert and patthat others may be involved in the industrial activity and that is quitealright .once again , thanks for listening .ken- attl . htm',\n",

will be combined under thename of bridgeline llc . ownership in the jv will be split 60 % texaco & 40 %enron . bridgeline gas marketing llc will be the entity that will be tradingon the pipelines under the new j . v . contracts and service agreements are inthe process of being drafted .enron will be providing the trading and commercial operations systems tosupport this j . v . texaco will be providing the scada system . i understandthat accounting is still being discussed . the trading , risk , & perhapsscheduling personnel for this jv will be initially relocated to the 21 stfloor of the enron building and will eventually move to probably the 3 allencenter once a more permanent spot can be built out . trading for the new jvwill start in early february for march production .to do ' s :accounting : i ' ve asked jim coffey to set up two work orders to capture ittransition and ongoing costs . texaco is also trying to set up a meeting nextmonday to step through the accounting flow so that we are all on the samepage and make sure there is nothing that will fall through the cracks .pc ' s : jim fussell is in the process of ordering the pc ' s for this jv at myrequest . i will need the work order numbers to track these costs .networks : i ' m coordinating with arshak and his team to make sure that thevoice and data networks are in place for eb 21 . once the more permanent spotis nailed down we will then need to do the same for that location . acombination of trader phones , lucent phones , stenfons and amtels have beenrequested .location on eb 21 : i ' m waiting on a call back from chris larson fromfacilities to find out what locations on 21 will be assigned to the new jv .currently half of the floor is empty but they are set up with high wallcubes . there may need to be some build out for the traders to low wallcubes . we can ' t set up the pc ' s , phones , amtels , etc until this is done .data conversion : i have requested from texaco the contract , deal andmeter / facility information we will need to set up in our systems to begintrading for march production . it may be possible to get an electronic dumpof this data from texaco if enron defines the data fields that we will need .we also need to set up the trading entities and portfolios . i will also needto know who will need to have access to this data so that we can set up thesystem security . i have received the names of the traders but i don ' t knowwho else will need access .interface between enron ' s unify pop ' s application and bridgeline ' s scadaapplication : i ' ve asked dave nommensen from enron to get with carryn wrightfrom texaco to begin the process of defining the interface between the twoapplications and estimate the time to build and implement the interface .there will also need to be a transition plan put in place where lrc ' srtu ' s / efm is redirected to the bridgeline scada system . in the meantimethere will be two scada systems and perhaps two gas controls until everythingis merged into one . this will probably mean some manual interfaces betweenpop ' s and scada for confirmed noms and efm volumes until the transition iscomplete .scada communications : currently the lrc rtu ' s / efm communicate back toenron ' s scada system via leased lines . bridgelines rtu ' s communicate back tothem via a microwave system . the new jv could save on communications costsby switching lrc ' s rtu communication to the microwave . perhaps this is bestdone as a part of the scada transition .accounting data needed by texaco for royalty purposes : this data needs to bebetter defined . i will follow up with john ledoux from texaco to get thisprocess started .hourly volumes : bridgeline currently has one utility customer who may bebilled on an hourly basis depending on the amount of swing . we need to talkthrough this process to see what enhancements may be needed . at leastinitially there will need to be some manual processes in place to support thebilling for this one customer .please let me know if you ' d like to meet on any of these topics . i can havemy assistant set up the meeting if needed . in the mean time i can be reachedat

       " 'as you might already know we had to reschedule our second meeting that wasscheduled for wednesday 2 / 16 to tuesday 2 / 22 in room 3013 . lunch will beprovided . i apologize and will avoid rescheduling our meetings in the future .i was encouraged by the excellent dialogue and contribution at our firstmeeting and believe we have the right group together to make the changes weknow are needed in our work hours .here is the list of items we agreed to cover at the next meeting :schedulers were going to touch base with their pipeline reps and othercontacts on the different schedules they are using and document and discussat the next meeting .each manager was going to discuss with their group what would work best fortheir desk and present this to the group at our next meetingbob was going to gather information on external 12 hour schedules and followup with hr on schedules being used at enronthe following is what i heard at the first meeting :our first item should be to establish a weekend and holiday schedule thatwould more or less guarantee ( other than maybe an occasional call ) you havethe weekend off . cross - training seemed to be the key here . some desks seemedto doubt this could be accomplished with current staffing levels .cross - training is not an easy thing to accomplish and takes a \" just do it \"attitude .there doesn \\' t have to be an across the board solution for logistics . howeverall solutions we come up with will need to be formally documented so it willbe easy to move to other alternatives as the business needs of each deskchanges .late daily hours are a reality and at some desks tied directly to traderswillingness to do deals at any time . as we get a better handle on what othercompanies are doing we might be able to find something that will help addressthis . everyone is realistic about the exceptions such as bid - week etc . andreally have no problems with those times when a long day is part of the job .there were mixed reactions to a dedicated weekend team as opposed to sometype of rotating group . mixed feelings about whether the group would be opento a mandatory rotating weekend schedule .feel free to get back to me if you have any comments or clarification . i \\' mlooking forward to our next meeting - bob',\n",

( i simply add a piece of masking tape since it \\' s easy tosee . ) then when routing the gauge ( and later , the panel ) , always keepthis mark against the straightedge . your dadoes should be right on .another email came in from mike , who suggested making two alignmentgauges . then you can clamp one at each end of the workpiece before youclamp the straightedge fence down . this prevents the \" wiggling \" thatoften occurs when one end is clamped before the other . great tip !a big thanks to all who have been sending in suggestions . it \\' s great tohear that so many people are enjoying the tips .talk to you again in a few weeks .jon garbisonon - line editorwoodsmithvisit our other woodworking and home improvement sites :100 + woodworking plans :woodsmith magazine :shopnotes magazine :workbench magazine :kits , jigs , tools , project plans :back issues :woodworking forums :to change your email address or resubscribe , sign up again atto unsubscribe , send empty email message to :note : your subscribed email address is',\n",
